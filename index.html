            <p><span>Hi, My name is Latisha and I am a front end web developer. My journey into this field started two years ago when I was working as a Dental Hygienist. I was working for a dental staffing agency and had the opportunity to work with different software. I became interested in how the system worked to assist dental staff in charting, writing notes, scheduling, and more. I found myself thinking of ways to improve the software for dental hygienists.</span>
                <br>
                <span>I began self-learning through online resources like Code Academy, YouTube, and Udemy. I found what I was learning to be exciting and fun but learning was not enough, I decided that I wanted to make this my career. I researched coding boot camps and decided to enroll in Bloc. Bloc prepares you to work in the field as a web developer with their lessons, assignments, projects, and mock interviews. Bloc challenges you by forcing you to research solutions on your own. I also had a mentor that I could pair-program with each week as well as slack support when I became stuck.</span>
                <br>
                <span>I am proud of the projects I have created through Bloc and beyond. My favorite project I have created this far is <a href="https://github.com/TishG/my-messenger" target="_blank">My Messenger</a>, a simple messaging application where users can send messages, read messages, see who's online, and see who's typing.</span>
                <br>
                <span>I enjoy building websites and working with other web developers and look forward to building more fascinating things in the future.</span></p>
